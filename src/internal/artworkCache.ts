/**
 * Remembers which artwork URL actually loaded, per source URL.
 *
 * Artwork is served from several candidate URLs (the original, plus resized YouTube variants)
 * and falls back to fetching the bytes through Rust when the webview cannot load the image
 * directly. Without this cache every mount restarts that walk from the top: a playlist scrolled
 * twice re-requests every failing candidate again, and proxied blobs were revoked on unmount,
 * so they were re-downloaded in full.
 *
 * Four things this holds, each for a different failure it prevents:
 *
 * - **Resolved URLs** — what finally worked, so a remount paints on the first frame. Bounded,
 *   with insertion order giving LRU for free: reading re-inserts, so eviction takes the coldest
 *   entry, and only then is an object URL revoked.
 * - **In-flight promises** — twenty rows sharing one album cover used to issue twenty identical
 *   proxy fetches, because nothing recorded that the first was already running.
 * - **Failures** — a source whose every candidate 404s would otherwise re-walk the entire
 *   ladder on every single mount, forever.
 * - **A persisted copy** of the plain (non-blob) resolutions, so a restart does not re-derive
 *   what was already learned. Object URLs are deliberately excluded: they die with the page.
