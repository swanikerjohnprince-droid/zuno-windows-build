/**
 * The track context menu's context object, deliberately alone in its own module.
 *
 * `createContext()` produces a new, unequal object every time the module holding it is
 * evaluated. Living in `TrackContextMenu.tsx` — a 700-line component that imports the loader,
 * the icons and the player store — it was re-created by Vite on any edit to *any* of those,
 * while `App.tsx` kept rendering the provider from the previous copy. Consumers then read the
 * new context, found no provider, and threw "must be used within TrackContextMenuProvider"
 * on a tree that unambiguously had one.
 *
 * This module imports only React and types, so nothing the app does day to day invalidates
 * it and the identity survives every hot update. It is a dev-only failure — a production
 * build evaluates each module once — but it is the kind that costs half an hour before
 * anyone thinks to blame the bundler.
