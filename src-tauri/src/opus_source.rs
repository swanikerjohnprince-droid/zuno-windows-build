 * 0.5 — and YouTube serves Opus-in-WebM for the large majority of tracks at `high` quality, and
 * as the *only* audio offered for many of them. So the container is read with symphonia, which
 * already handles Matroska and Ogg, and the packets inside go to libopus.
 *
 * Everything else — AAC, FLAC, MP3, ALAC, Vorbis, WAV — stays on `rodio::Decoder`, which does
 * have decoders for those. This module exists for exactly one codec.
