/**

 *    *below* the artwork, which meant the carousel stage had to reserve guessed-at extra
 *    height for captions — and that guess broke the moment the type scale grew. Putting the
 *    caption on the art over a scrim makes the card exactly the box the carousel gives it,
 *    so the layout cannot drift out of sync with the type.
 *
 * 2. **The carousel scales its items**, so a caption inside the card inherits that scale for
 *    free: the centre pick reads at full size and the outer ones recede into thumbnails.
 *    The hierarchy comes from the geometry rather than from styling each position.
