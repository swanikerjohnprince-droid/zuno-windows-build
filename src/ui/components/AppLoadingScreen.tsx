 * The accent bloom, as a gradient rather than a blurred circle.
 *
 * It was a 420px solid disc with `blur-[120px]`. A filter that large is not cheap the way a
 * background is: the element becomes its own compositor layer, and Chromium has to allocate an
 * intermediate texture expanded by roughly three times the radius on every side — a 420px disc
 * rasterising into something past 1100px square, in multiple passes, on the startup screen
 * where the GPU process is still warming up.
 *
 * A blurred solid circle is a radial gradient. This one is drawn straight into the raster pass:
 * no filter, no layer, no intermediate. The box is grown to 660px because the gradient has to
 * cover the area the blur used to bleed into.
