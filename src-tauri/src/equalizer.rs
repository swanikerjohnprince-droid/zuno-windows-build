 * A cascade of peaking biquads between the decoder and the deck. This is only possible at all

 * `<audio>` path would need a second implementation in Web Audio.
 *
 * The settings are process-global rather than per-source. Two decks are live during a crossfade
 * and both have to sound the same, and a slider has to move the track *playing*, not the next
 * one — so a source reads shared state rather than capturing gains when it was built.
