/**
 * Self-check for sidebar library filtering and sorting. No test runner in this project, so:
 *
 *   npx esbuild src/ui/components/sidebarLibrary.check.ts --bundle --platform=node --format=esm
 *     --outfile=check.mjs && node check.mjs
 *
 * The dangerous case here is not a wrong sort — that is visible. It is dragging while the list
 * is filtered or alphabetised, which silently persists an order derived from a list the user
 * was never looking at, and only shows up later as a scrambled sidebar.
