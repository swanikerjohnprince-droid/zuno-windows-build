## About

Zuno brings YouTube Music to the desktop as its own application, not a browser tab. There is
no official desktop client, so the goal is a fast, native-feeling one that holds up with large
libraries.

If you find it useful, **starring the repo** genuinely helps.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Search** | Ctrl+Space from anywhere, across artists, songs, playlists and albums |
| **Multiple tabs** | Each tab keeps its own queue, volume and player state — start an album in one, browse in another, and the first keeps playing |
| **Offline downloads** | Save a song, a selection, or a whole album or playlist, with its own quality setting and a size cap you control |
| **Mini player** | A morphing capsule that appears when you tab away; drag it anywhere, hover to expand |
| **Synced lyrics** | Line-by-line lyrics that follow the song, unlike the official web client. Click a line to jump to it, nudge the timing if a match is off, and pick which source is tried first |
| **Lyrics translation** | A translation under each line, in any of twenty languages, with an adjustable text size |
| **Like & dislike** | Rate from the row, the player or the right-click menu — ratings sync to your YouTube Music account |
| **Batch actions** | Shift/ctrl-select rows, then queue, download, add to a playlist or remove them together |
| **Queue control** | Collapses to an artwork-only rail; end the queue at a track, generate more from it, shuffle or clear what's next |
| **Recommendations** | Personalised suggestions plus a "surprise me" shuffle — hide the carousel if you would rather open on your library |
| **Browse** | Explore, charts, moods and genres, and podcasts, with mood chips you can drill into |
| **Local files** | Folders from your own machine sit alongside your library, with a tag editor for fixing metadata |
| **Discord & Last.fm** | Rich Presence and scrobbling, each toggleable straight from the toolbar |
| **Account support** | Sign in with Google for your library and playlists, and switch between channels on the same account |
| **Playlist import/export** | Save a playlist to a file and bring it back, on this machine or another |
| **Desktop integration** | Media keys, minimise to tray, launch at login, remembered window position, rebindable shortcuts |
| **Light & dark themes** | Follows the OS by default, or pin either one — plus a reduced-motion mode |
| **Caching** | Playlists, lyrics and artwork are cached, so revisits are instant |
| **Auto-updates** | Signed updates install themselves; no manual re-download |

<br />

## Download

Grab the newest installer from the **[latest release](https://github.com/noFAYZ/zuno/releases/latest)**
for Windows, macOS or Linux.

On Arch and derivatives, install from the AUR instead:

```bash
yay -S zuno     # or: paru -S zuno
```

<br />

## Platform support

- **Windows** — primary target; the most tested of the three.
- **macOS** — supported; the build is unsigned (see below).
- **Linux** — supported across major distros; runs on your system's WebKitGTK and GStreamer.

### Linux notes

Install the `.deb` or `.rpm`, or `zuno` from the AUR on Arch. All three run on your system's
WebKitGTK (rendering) and GStreamer (playback) rather than bundling their own.

<details>
<summary>🔇 No sound, or "YouTube player error 5"</summary>

Most distros don't install the codecs YouTube needs by default:

```bash
# Debian, Ubuntu, Mint
sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good

# Fedora (gstreamer1-libav needs RPM Fusion enabled)
sudo dnf install gstreamer1-libav gstreamer1-plugins-base gstreamer1-plugins-good

# Arch — installed automatically with the AUR package
sudo pacman -S gst-libav gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good
```

Confirm they registered:

```bash
gst-inspect-1.0 | grep -E 'avdec_aac|avdec_h264'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>⬜ A blank grey window</summary>

A WebKitGTK rendering problem under Wayland, most often on Nvidia. Launch from a terminal
with one of:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 zuno
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 zuno
GDK_BACKEND=x11 zuno
```

Launching from an app menu instead? Add the same variable to the `Exec` line of
`zuno.desktop` (typically `/usr/share/applications/zuno.desktop`, or
`~/.local/share/applications/zuno.desktop` for a user install):

```
Exec=env WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 zuno
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>⚠️ An EGL error on launch</summary>

Preload the system Wayland client library:

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libwayland-client.so ~/Downloads/zuno*.AppImage
```

In Gear Lever, add `LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libwayland-client.so` to Zuno's environment variables.

</details>

#### 🪵 Anything else

Open **Settings → Library → Application log**, reproduce the problem, and attach the log to
an issue along with your desktop environment, display server (X11 or Wayland) and distro —
those three narrow down a Linux bug faster than anything else. The log also lives at
`~/.local/share/com.zuno.desktop/logs/current.log`.

### macOS notes

#### "Apple is not able to verify that it is free from malware"

The macOS builds aren't signed with an Apple Developer ID, so Gatekeeper blocks them on first
launch. This isn't a malware finding — it means the binary is unsigned. Drag Zuno to
Applications, then either:

- open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the message about Zuno, and click
  **Open Anyway**, or
- clear the quarantine flag yourself:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Zuno.app
```

Build from source instead if you'd rather not trust a prebuilt, unsigned binary.

#### A Keychain prompt on sign-in

Zuno stores one encryption key in its own Keychain entry and encrypts your YouTube Music
session with it before writing anything to the app data directory. Choose **Always Allow** to
avoid repeated prompts — or **Deny** if you don't intend to sign in to YouTube Music.
