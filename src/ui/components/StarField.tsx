/**
 * Ambient window background.
 *
 * Adapted from docs/tauribg.txt: two blurred colour blobs bleeding down from the top edge,
 * over a radial vignette that darkens toward the bottom. The reference uses an indigo
 * `primary` plus `red-400`; here both blobs sit in the app's own accent family so the
 * backdrop reinforces the identity instead of introducing a second hue.
 *
 * Kept deliberately low-contrast: this sits behind real UI, so it must never compete with
 * text or controls. Callers gate it on Paper-PC mode (see Layout.tsx), which is also why
 * this is plain CSS — no WebGL, no animation, nothing to disable.
 *
 * The blobs are blurred at `2xl` (40px) rather than `3xl` (64px). Both are always on screen,
 * and blur radius is what sizes the compositor's intermediate textures — but the shapes here
 * are already `rounded-full` gradients fading to transparent, so most of the softness comes
 * from the fill rather than from the filter.
