/**
 * Per-effect kill switches, for finding out which visual effect is actually costing the GPU.
 *
 * Paper-PC mode turns everything off at once, which tells you the app is cheaper without
 * effects but not *which* one was expensive. These are the same thing sliced up: flip one,
 * watch the GPU graph, flip it back.
 *
 * Every switch is a CSS override keyed off one `data-fx-off` attribute on <html> (see the
 * block in global.css) rather than a prop threaded through components — the effects live in
 * ~40 files and a debug switch is not worth touching 40 files for. `motion` is the exception:
 * Motion/React animates inline styles, which no stylesheet can override, so it is read in
 * App.tsx and fed to <MotionConfig>.

 * component that branches on the bare hook — picking a variant, gating a
 * `requestAnimationFrame` loop, choosing `scrollTo` behaviour — never sees Reduced motion mode
 * or the switch above, and keeps doing the work in the mode meant to stop it.
 *
 * The vendored beUI components under src/components/motion still call the bare hook. That is
 * fine: their `reduce` only ever picks between two Motion transitions, which `<MotionConfig>`
 * already reduces. This is for the app's own components, where `reduce` gates real work.
