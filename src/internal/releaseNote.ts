 * version is all it takes to show the new text exactly once per machine.
 *
 * The shape is fixed, and every release follows it:
 *
 *   **Topic** — one line, in plain language, about what changed for the listener.
 *   ...one line per topic, four or so at most...

 *   Report anything broken on GitHub, or come say hello at /r/ZunoMusic.
 *
 *   Thanks :)
 *
 * No opening paragraph. This dialog interrupts a launch nobody asked to have interrupted, so
 * it earns its place by being read in a glance — a lead-in is the first thing skipped, and it
 * pushes the lines that matter below where the eye lands.

**Sound** — pick your exact output device (real speaker/headphone names on Linux too), plus a bypass toggle and mini EQ right in the player bar.
**Playlists** — shuffle now truly shuffles the whole playlist from wherever you are in it, loop cycles properly instead of getting stuck, and any playlist can be hidden from your library.
**Discovery** — start a radio station from any track, and pages load in with proper skeletons instead of a blank flash.
**Fixes** — some tracks auto-skipping a few seconds in, crossfade stalling when minimized, YouTube embed errors now falling back automatically, and a second launch refocusing Zuno instead of opening twice.

 * Whether this launch is the first one after an update.
 *
 * A fresh install is deliberately not an update — greeting a first-time user with "here is
 * what changed" is noise about software they have never run. But "no version recorded" does
 * not mean "fresh install": on the very release that introduces this feature, *nobody* has a
 * recorded version, because nothing was ever writing one. 1.2.0 shipped exactly that bug and
 * showed the note to no one.
 *
 * So a missing version falls back to `hasPriorUse` — whether this profile shows any trace of
 * the app having been run before. That distinguishes the two cases the stored version alone
 * cannot.
 *
 * Any difference counts, not just an increase: a downgrade or a sideways build is still a
 * version whose notes were never read, and comparing version strings numerically is a parser
 * nobody needs here.
