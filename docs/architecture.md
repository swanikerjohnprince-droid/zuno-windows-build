# Architecture — Zuno

An unofficial desktop YouTube Music client. Tauri 2 (Rust) shell + React 19 / TypeScript
front end, bundled by Vite 7. No router and no Redux — plain classes with `useSyncExternalStore`
and direct Tauri IPC. The UI is built on Tailwind v4 plus animated components vendored from the
[beUI](https://beui.dev) registry, with [Solar](https://solar-icons.vercel.app) icons.

- Version: `1.2.1` (`package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` are kept in lockstep)
- Bundle id: `com.zuno.desktop` · Rust crate `zuno` / lib `zuno_lib`
- Platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux
- Companion docs: [frontend.md](./frontend.md) (UI), [backend.md](./backend.md) (Rust/IPC)

Four rules explain most of the design:

1. **All network traffic to Google goes through Rust** (`proxy_http_request`) so the WebView's
   CORS/cookie rules never apply, cookie auth can be signed properly, and rotated `Set-Cookie`
   values can be merged back into the stored session.
2. **There are three playback engines and the user picks one** (`ui/settings/audioEngine.ts`).
   `rust` is the default: it resolves the signed URL, decodes it in the Rust process and plays
   straight out to the sound card — no subframe, no media element, no audio in the renderer. A
   resolve or fetch that Google refuses is **not fatal**: `ensureTrackLoaded` catches it and plays
   that one track on the IFrame deck instead, which is what made defaulting to it safe.
   `iframe` hands the video id to a hidden YouTube IFrame player, dodging the 403s
   that signed googlevideo URLs return when replayed from a different context — at the cost of a
   `youtube.com` subframe process, roughly 90 MB. `native` resolves and downloads the track through
   Rust and plays it from an `<audio>` element, with no subframe at all. `rust` resolves the same
   URL and decodes it in the Rust process with symphonia, out to the sound card through cpal — no
   subframe, no media element, and no audio in the renderer at all. Local and downloaded tracks
   always take a non-IFrame path regardless of the setting.
3. **Downloads are a separate path from playback.** `offline_audio_save` fetches the same signed URL
   in Rust with a PO token, in 4 MiB ranges, and stores the bytes on disk; playback of a downloaded
   track then never touches the network.
4. **Every piece of durable state has two homes**: `localStorage` (synchronous, drives the UI)
   and a Rust-owned JSON file (survives WebView data wipes). See §6.

## 2. Process and window model

| Window | Label | Entry | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main | `main` | `index.html` → `src/main.tsx` | 1280×900, min 900×600, `decorations: false`, `transparent: true`, `shadow: false` (custom title bar and window edge; Linux forces decorations on at runtime) |
| Mini player | `mini-player` | `mini.html` → `src/mini.tsx` | transparent, always-on-top, `skipTaskbar`. **Created on first show and destroyed when the main window regains focus** — a hidden webview keeps its whole renderer process (~32 MB), so only destroying returns it. Create and destroy are serialized against each other in `miniPlayer.ts`, because alt-tab fires blur and focus within milliseconds. |
| Sign-in | `youtube-music-login` | Google sign-in URL | Created on demand by Rust during `sign_in_youtube_music` (and headlessly by `refresh_youtube_music_cookie`), destroyed after the session cookie appears |

Vite is configured with two Rollup inputs (`vite.config.ts`), so main and mini ship as separate
HTML entry points sharing the same module graph. `@` is aliased to `src/`.

**Production frontend hosting is unusual.** In release builds `run()` picks a free port, serves
`dist/` through `tauri-plugin-localhost`, and rewrites `frontend_dist` to `http://localhost:<port>`.
The YouTube IFrame API refuses to run under the `tauri://` / `asset://` origins, so the app needs a
real `http://` origin. Dev builds use the normal Vite dev server on port 1420.

**Rust → frontend events:**

| Event | Emitted when | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| `main-window-backgrounded` | main window loses focus and mini player isn't focused (100 ms debounce) | `App.tsx` — creates and shows the mini player window |
| `main-window-minimized` | same check, but the window turned out to be minimized | `App.tsx` — creates and shows it even during drag suppression |
| `window-focused` | main window regains focus | `App.tsx` — destroys the mini player window, triggers connection recovery |
| `windows-media-control` | SMTC or taskbar thumbnail button pressed | `useMediaSession` |
| `offline-download-progress` | per-chunk progress during `offline_audio_save` | `player/offlineStore.ts` |
| `native-audio-position` | every 250 ms while the Rust engine is playing | `player/rustAudio.ts` — the cached playhead |
| `native-audio-ended` | the Rust engine's active deck ran out of samples | `player/rustAudio.ts` → the playback-owning `AudioEngine` |
| `local-audio-changed` | `notify` watcher sees a change under a watched music folder | `main.tsx` → `notifyLocalPlaylistsChanged()` |

**Mini ↔ main** is a set of plain Tauri events, no shared controllers:
main emits `player-state-sync` / `player-time-sync` / `player-volume-sync`; the mini window emits
`mini-player:request-sync`, `:toggle-play-pause`, `:skip-next`, `:skip-previous`, `:seek`,
`:volume`, `:position-changed`, `:restore-main`.

## 3. Layers

```
src/
├─ main.tsx / mini.tsx      bootstrap: settings hydration, error hooks, React root
├─ internal/                cross-cutting: cache, app settings, logging, updater, equality helpers
├─ datasource/              "where does music come from" — abstract API + YouTube Music impl
├─ player/                  playback engine, queue, tabs, library, offline, integrations
├─ components/              vendored beUI primitives (registry paths, do not restructure)
├─ lib/                     beUI helpers: cn, ease tokens, use-hover-capable
└─ ui/                      app components, pages, settings modules, stores, icons.tsx
```

Dependency direction is strictly downward: `ui → player → datasource → internal → Tauri IPC`.
Nothing in `datasource/` imports from `ui/`.

Alongside the source, `*.check.ts` files hold executable assertions for the non-trivial pure logic
(queue moves, lyric timing, artwork picking, translation parsing, playlist transfer, prop equality,
…). `npm run check` bundles and runs each in its own process — see §8.

### 3.1 `internal/` — cross-cutting utilities

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `cache.ts` | Thin wrapper over the Rust file cache (`cache_get/set/stats/clear`). JSON in, JSON out. Default budget 4 GiB. |
| `appSettings.ts` | `app_setting_get/set/remove` + `app_settings_clear`. Never throws (except `clear`). |
| `durableLocalSetting.ts` | The localStorage ⇄ durable-settings mirroring helpers (`read/write/hydrateLocal{Boolean,Json}Setting`). Every settings module in `ui/settings/` is built on these. |
| `logging.ts` | `logInternalDebug/Info/Warn/Error`. Redacts cookies, tokens, authorization headers and full URLs before forwarding to Rust via `frontend_log`, then also mirrors to the console. |
| `updateChecker.ts` | `tauri-plugin-updater` wrapper; on macOS it degrades to a GitHub Releases API check (notify-only, no in-app install). 24 h per-version snooze in localStorage. |
| `releaseNote.ts` | The one-time "what's new" note, keyed to the installed version rather than a flag. |
| `artworkCache.ts` | Remembers which artwork candidate URL actually loaded, per source URL, so remounts don't rewalk the fallback chain. Hydrated before React mounts. |
| `audioQuality.ts` | Streaming and download quality caps, set independently. |
| `lyricsSourcePreference.ts` | Which lyric provider is promoted to the front of the race. A preference, not a restriction. |
| `base64.ts` | Byte-oriented base64 for binary payloads crossing IPC (`btoa` is Latin-1 only). |
| `shallowEqual.ts` / `propsEqual.ts` | One-level equality for store selectors and for `memo` on components handed inline arrows. |

### 3.2 `datasource/` — content abstraction

`DataSource` (`datasource/DataSource.ts`) is an abstract class where *everything except
`getTrack` and `getStreamUrl` is optional*. Controllers feature-detect (`this.dataSource.getLyrics?.(…)`),
so a partial implementation degrades gracefully instead of crashing. The optional surface now covers
search, link resolution, session lifecycle, multi-account (`listAccounts` / `selectAccount`),
library, albums, artists (subscribe, notification level), playlists (create/rename/describe/delete/
reorder/add/remove), likes and ratings, notifications, recommendations, related shelves, browse
pages, and lyrics.

Domain types live in `datasource/types.ts`: `Track`, `Album`, `Playlist`, `Artist`, `ArtistPage`,
`SearchResults`, `TrackPage`, `Lyrics`, `BrowsePage`/`BrowseShelf`/`BrowseTarget`, `FeedNotification`,
`AccountOption`/`AccountProfile`, `AuthPrompt`/`AuthProgress`, `LibrarySnapshot`. `Track.source` is
`"youtube" | "local"` — the single discriminator that routes local files down a different
playback path.

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `youtube/YouTubeMusicDataSource.ts` | **The only implementation wired up.** ~6.1k lines. Owns Innertube clients, library/playlist/album/artist fetching, browse surfaces, search, recommendations, likes, ratings, notifications, accounts, lyrics, and stream resolution. |
| `youtube/tauriFetch.ts` | `fetch`-shaped adapter that funnels youtubei.js through `proxy_http_request`. Computes the `SAPISIDHASH` authorization header, sets `origin`/`referer` to `music.youtube.com`, and rewrites `www.youtube.com/youtubei/*` → `music.youtube.com` when the client id is `67` (YouTube Music). |
| `youtube/poToken.ts` | Proof-of-Origin token minting via `bgutils-js`. Signed googlevideo URLs are only served to a session that can prove it came from a real browser; without it the second and later downloads 403. |
| `youtube/lyricsSources.ts` | The provider table. Sources are grouped into waves: wave 1 is raced in parallel, wave 2 (the expensive YouTube calls) only runs if wave 1 came back empty. Per-source `timeoutMs` and a `LyricsSourceAttempt` trail for the UI. |
| `youtube/links.ts` | Parses a pasted YouTube / YouTube Music URL without a network round-trip; returns null for the shapes that genuinely need the API (`@handles`, `youtu.be` redirects, vanity channels). |
| `youtube/artwork.ts` | Walks arbitrary Innertube response objects collecting `{url,width,height}` candidates and picks the largest; plus `i.ytimg.com` fallbacks by video id. |
| `translate.ts` | Lyric translation through Google's keyless `translate_a` endpoint. Every failure is normal: a miss returns null and the caller shows the original words. |
| `youtube/YouTubeDataSource.ts` | **Dead code.** Older non-Music implementation, no longer imported anywhere (see §9). |

Caching inside the data source is a consistent stale-while-revalidate pattern:

```
getX() → read cache → if usable, return it and kick off a background refresh
                    → else await refresh, write cache, return
refresh promises are deduped per key in a Map so concurrent callers share one request
```

Cache keys are versioned strings (`youtube-music:library:v5`, `youtube-music:track:v1:<id>`,
`lyrics:synced:v2:<id>`, …); bumping the version is how you invalidate a schema change.

### 3.3 `player/` — playback and app state

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `AudioEngine.ts` | Owns **two** hidden YouTube IFrame decks, an optional `HTMLAudioElement`, and — in `rust` mode — a handle to the Rust engine's own pair of decks (`rustAudio.ts`), routing between them on the audio-engine setting. On the Rust path every method below delegates and this class holds only bookkeeping: which track is on which deck, so `hasPreloaded` stays synchronous. Routes between the first two on `shouldUseNativeAudio()` — a live read of the audio-engine setting, so a change takes effect on the next track rather than the next launch. The standby deck holds the *next* track already cued, which is what makes transitions gapless; with a non-zero crossfade the two decks' volumes are ramped past each other. **Neither applies in native mode**, which has no deck to preload onto. `releaseIframePlayer()` frees the decks (and their subframe process) without disposing the engine; a module-level listener calls it on every engine except the current playback owner when the setting flips to native. `playbackClaimId` + `playbackOwner` guarantee only one engine makes sound at a time. |
| `rustAudio.ts` | The frontend half of the Rust engine: the `native_audio_*` invokes, plus the cached position that lets `getCurrentTime()` stay synchronous. Position is pushed from Rust on a 250 ms `native-audio-position` event rather than polled, because a progress frame cannot await an `invoke`. The `native-audio-ended` subscription is **process-wide and dispatched to the playback owner** — one per engine would have every open tab advance its own queue on the same track end. |
| `Queue.ts` | Pure queue data structure with three regions: played/current, a **manual queue** segment (`playNext` / `addToQueue`), and automatic upcoming tracks. Shuffle only touches the automatic region and remembers the original order so it can be restored. `move()` rejects cross-region moves. |
| `PlayerController.ts` | One per tab. Orchestrates DataSource → AudioEngine → Queue, playback order (shuffle and repeat compose independently), crossfade/gapless settings, playback rate, stop-after-track, radio/autoplay refills, history, error surfacing, session export/restore, and Discord presence updates. Warms the next track as soon as the current one starts — its metadata always, its audio too on the native engine — because a skip lands whenever the listener decides, not only in the last few seconds. |
| `TabManager.ts` | Owns the `Map<tabId, PlayerController>`. Distinguishes the **focused** tab (what you're looking at) from the **playback owner** (what's making sound), and suspends/resumes engines on switch. |
| `playerStore.ts` | Composition root: constructs the data source and the three controllers, restores the persisted session, and exposes `usePlayerState` / `usePlayerSelector` / `usePlayerSession` / `useLibraryState` plus an `ActivePlayerController` facade that always targets the right tab. |
| `LibraryController.ts` | Sign-in/out, account switching, staged auth progress (`browser → session → library`), library snapshot loading with timeouts and post-sign-in retries, silent session recovery, optimistic like/rating mutations with rollback, and local-playlist merging. |
| `SearchController.ts` | Trims queries, falls back from `search` to `searchTracks`, forwards streaming `onUpdate` callbacks. |
| `offlineStore.ts` | Download queue and manifest. Statuses `absent → queued → downloading → ready \| failed`, a byte ceiling (default 8 GiB), progress fed by the `offline-download-progress` event, and `useOfflineState()` for the UI. |
| `playHistory.ts` | Local play log (500 entries, oldest trimmed) behind the History page. A replay inside a short window updates the existing entry instead of appending. |
| `localPlaylists.ts` | Local-file playlists: folder paths, per-playlist added tracks, ordering — all in localStorage, resolved through `local_audio_scan`, kept live by the folder watcher. |
| `playlistMembership.ts` | Remembers which playlists a track is in (1000 tracks, pruned oldest-first) so the context menu can render without a round-trip. |
| `playlistTransfer.ts` | Versioned JSON export/import of playlists. |
| `recentPlaylists.ts` | Last-played timestamps per playlist for sidebar ordering. |
| `playbackSettings.ts` | Volume/mute, playback rate, crossfade seconds, gapless flag — mirrored to durable settings. |
| `appSession.ts` | Whole-app session snapshot in localStorage: tabs + per-tab player sessions. Restores `playing` as `paused` so launching the app never autoplays. Honours the "restore tabs and queues" setting. `saveAppSession` compares the serialized payload against the last one written and skips the (synchronous, disk-backed) `setItem` when nothing moved — it is called from three places and most calls are no-ops. |
| `DiscordRPC.ts` | Sanitizes presence payloads (128-char text limit, HTTPS-only artwork from a trusted host allowlist) before invoking Rust. |
| `LastFm.ts` | Tracks listened seconds, sends `nowPlaying` once per track and scrobbles at `min(240 s, duration/2)`; tracks shorter than 31 s never scrobble. |
| `useMediaSession.ts` | Bridges player state to Windows SMTC (via `update_windows_media_session` + `windows-media-control` events) or, elsewhere, the WebView `navigator.mediaSession`. |
| `shuffleTracks.ts` | Fisher–Yates helper. |
| `Recommender.ts` | **Dead code** — returns `[]`, nothing imports it. |

**Account-facing choices** live in `ui/settings/youtubeAccount.ts`: whether playback resolves
streams with the session attached, and whether finished plays are reported to YouTube's history.
Both default off — each changes what leaves the machine. Enabling scrobbling enables signed-in
resolution with it; the reverse is not true, so signed-in playback without history is reachable.

### 3.4 `ui/` — React

Detailed in [frontend.md](./frontend.md). Summary: `App.tsx` is the single stateful root
(tabs, navigation history, onboarding, updates, window/mini-player wiring, global shortcuts);
every page below it is `lazy`-loaded, and everything else is presentational or reads a store hook
directly.

### 3.5 `src-tauri/src/` — Rust

Detailed in [backend.md](./backend.md).

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `main.rs` | Sets the Windows AppUserModelID, strips the WebView2 diagnostics env var, calls `run()` |
| `lib.rs` (~3.9k lines) | Commands, cache, settings, logging, keyring/session + cookie jar, HTTP proxy, audio fetch, offline store, local files and tags, folder watcher, media server, tray, window event wiring |
| `discord_rpc.rs` | `DiscordIpcClient` lifecycle and activity building |
| `lastfm.rs` | MD5-signed Last.fm API calls, session in keyring |
| `windows_media.rs` | SMTC integration + taskbar thumbnail toolbar buttons |
| `macos_media.rs` | `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` integration |

## 4. Key flows

### 4.1 Boot

```
main.tsx
  hydrateArtworkCache()              → before paint, so no fallback-icon flash
  applyPlatformAttributes()          → data-platform-linux on <html>
  applyTheme() + watchSystemTheme()  → data-theme; "system" keeps following the OS
  applyPaperPcMode()                 → data-paper-pc (reduced-motion / no blur theme)
  applyNativeWindowControls()        → window decorations on/off
  hydrateMainWindowGeometry() → restoreMainWindowGeometry()
  Promise.all([ ~18 hydrate* calls: paperPc, theme, windowControls, miniPlayer, playerControls,
                queuePanel, tray, audioQuality, audioEngineMode, lastFm, discord, sidebar,
                keyboardShortcuts, toolbarItems, homeSections, playbackSettings, playHistory,
                sessionRestore ])
  DiscordRpcService.init()
  window error / unhandledrejection hooks
  createRoot().render(<StrictMode><ErrorBoundary><App/></ErrorBoundary></StrictMode>)
  syncLocalAudioWatcher() + listen("local-audio-changed")

playerStore.ts (module side effect, imported by App)
  new YouTubeMusicDataSource()
  new LibraryController / SearchController / TabManager
  loadAppSession() → tabManager.restoreSession(...)  (or create tab "1")

App mount
  libraryController.initialize() → cached library first, then restoreSession() + refresh()
  loading screen dismisses after ≥1 s, ≤4 s
```

Hydration order matters: durable settings are read from Rust *after* the synchronous
localStorage read, so the UI paints instantly with the last known values and corrects itself
once the file read resolves.

### 4.2 Playing a track

```
UI onClick
  → playerController.playTrackById(videoId, queue?, autoplayWhenQueueEnds?)
  → tabManager.claimFocusedPlayer()      (suspends the previous playback owner)
  → PlayerController.playTrackById
       queue.set(playbackQueue, startIndex)          isPlaylistMode = queue>1 && !autoplay
       dataSource.getTrack(videoId)                  cached, merged with the queued row
       ensureTrackLoaded(track)
          local / downloaded → local_audio_read | offline_audio_source → <audio>
          remote, iframe     → audioEngine.loadTrack(videoId) → deck cueVideoById, wait for CUED
          remote, native     → getStreamData() → fetch_audio_source → <audio>
                               (also releases the IFrame decks, freeing the subframe)
       audioEngine.play()                            claims global playback, waits for PLAYING
       setState({status:"playing"}) → recordPlay(track)
  → emit() → React re-render + Discord presence + Last.fm nowPlaying
```

In `iframe` mode, ahead of the end of a track the engine cues the next one onto the **standby
deck**. Track end (`onEnded`) then hands over: with `crossfadeSec` at 0 the swap is gapless; above 0
the two decks' volumes ramp past each other. Native mode has no standby deck, so it neither
preloads nor crossfades — `onEnded` on the `<audio>` element simply advances the queue.
Repeat-one replays instead; otherwise the next queue item; otherwise
queue-end recommendations (playlist mode); otherwise the radio queue if autoplay is on; otherwise
pause. `refillAutomaticQueue()` tops the automatic region back up when fewer than 10 tracks remain
and the queue isn't a fixed playlist.

Every async step is guarded by a monotonically increasing request id (`playTrackRequestId`,
`radioQueueRequestId`, `loadRequestId`), so a fast skip cancels the in-flight work rather than
letting a stale response overwrite state.

### 4.3 Stream resolution

| Track kind | Path |
|---|---|
| YouTube, streaming, `iframe` mode | No stream URL is fetched at all — the IFrame deck handles it from the video id. |
| YouTube, streaming, `native` mode | `getStreamData` → `resolveStreamUrl` → `fetch_audio_source` downloads it in parallel ranges and re-serves it from the local media server. The MP4 `ftyp` check only applies when MP4 was the format asked for — `high` now reaches Opus, which has no `ftyp` box. |
| YouTube, streaming, `rust` mode | `getRustStreamData` → `resolveStreamUrl` → the signed URL and cookie go straight to `native_audio_load`. Rust publishes an empty `MediaBuffer` sized from the URL's own `clen`, starts the same ranged fill, and hands symphonia a reader over it — so what a click waits for is the 128 KiB head chunk, not the file. Nothing is published to the media server and no audio crosses IPC. |
| Local / downloaded, `rust` mode | `getRustStreamData` returns a path or a track id. No base64, no media server — Rust opens the file. |
| YouTube, downloaded | `offline_audio_source` serves the stored bytes from the media server, with Range support. No network. |
| YouTube, download | `getStreamData` → Innertube `getBasicInfo` → best adaptive `audio/mp4` at the configured quality → decipher → PO token → `offline_audio_save` fetches it in 4 MiB ranges, 6 at a time, emitting progress. |
| Local file | `local_audio_read` returns base64 bytes + a MIME type guessed from the extension; the frontend builds a `Blob` object URL. |

`shouldUseNativeAudio()` was hardcoded `false` from v1.2.65 — the backend download path answered
403 for remote streams, so every platform was reverted to the IFrame player. **PO tokens are what
fixed it**: the download feature has used this same resolve-and-fetch path successfully ever since,
which is what made it safe to offer again as a setting. It stays opt-in because native resolves and
downloads the whole track before the first sample plays (so a track starts slower) and because
gapless and crossfade ride the standby IFrame deck, so neither applies to it.

**Two resolvers, not one.** `resolveStreamUrl` (playback) and `resolveDownloadUrl` (offline queue)
are thin wrappers over a shared private `resolveStream(track, quality, clientOrder)`. Only the
playback one reads `usesAuthenticatedStreaming()`; the download one has no conditional and no
import of it, so downloads cannot inherit the setting through a mis-edited branch. `playerStore`
binds `resolveDownloadUrl` into the offline queue, which puts that guarantee at the wiring site.

### 4.4 Authentication

Cookie-based, not OAuth:

```
signIn()
  → Rust sign_in_youtube_music
      opens the "youtube-music-login" window at accounts.google.com
      clear_all_browsing_data() first
      polls once a second, up to 300 s, for cookies on music.youtube.com
      success = has SAPISID|__Secure-1PAPISID|__Secure-3PAPISID AND the window is on music.youtube.com
      serializes them into one Cookie header, persists, closes the window, returns the header
  → frontend clears the data cache (unless it's the same account), rebuilds the Innertube
    client, refreshes the library
```

`LibraryController` reports the stages — `browser`, `session`, `library` — through `authProgress`,
so the overlay can tell "waiting on a browser window" apart from "fetching your library".
`cookie_account_identity()` compares the `SAPISID` across a re-sign-in: the same account keeps its
cache, a different one drops it.

**Keeping the session alive.** Google rotates session cookies continuously. Every proxied response
from a YouTube host has its `Set-Cookie` headers merged into a Rust-side cookie jar
(`apply_set_cookie`): a rotated value replaces the stale one, a tombstone drops it, an unchanged
value writes nothing. Credential rotations persist immediately; the noisy `SIDCC` family may wait
for a 5-minute interval. `refresh_youtube_music_cookie` re-mints a lapsed session in a hidden window
without user interaction.

Storage differs by OS: Windows/Linux split the header into ≤900-byte chunks across up to 16 keyring
entries plus a `chunks:<n>` manifest (keyrings cap entry size); macOS encrypts the header with
AES-256-GCM into `youtube-music-session-v1.bin` under the app data dir and keeps only the 32-byte
key in the keychain. The keyring service name is still the legacy `com.ytmusicdock.app` so existing
sign-ins survived the rename, and `migrate_legacy_app_data` copies over data from the older
`com.justanothermusicclient.desktop` identifier on first run.

### 4.5 Search and browse

`SearchOverlay` (Ctrl/⌘+K) does three things at once: fuzzy-matches your own playlists and albums
locally, requests `getSearchSuggestions`, and on submit opens a `search` view (optionally in a new
tab). A pasted YouTube link is recognised by `looksLikeYouTubeLink` and resolved instead of searched.
`SearchResultsPage` renders the mixed `SearchResults` with streaming `onUpdate` callbacks painting
partial results as they arrive. `BrowsePage` renders the non-search discovery surfaces
(`explore` / `charts` / `moods` / `podcasts`) through `getBrowsePage`, and `RelatedPage` renders
`getRelated` shelves for a single track.

---

## 5. State management

No state library. Three patterns, in order of preference:

1. **Class + listener set + `useSyncExternalStore`** — `TabManager`, `LibraryController`,
   `playerUIStore`, `ambientArtworkStore`, `offlineStore`. Subscribers get a `getSnapshot` that must
   return a stable reference; controllers cache their snapshot and invalidate it on `emit()`.
   `usePlayerSelector` narrows that with `shallowEqual` so a component only re-renders for the
   fields it read.
2. **localStorage + custom `window` event + `useSyncExternalStore`** — every module under
   `ui/settings/`. The event name (e.g. `mini-player-enabled-change`) is the change channel, and the
   `storage` event covers the other window.
3. **`useState` in `App.tsx`** — tabs, navigation history, onboarding, update toast. Tab state is
   pure React; only the per-tab `PlayerController` lives outside React.

### The focused-vs-owner split

`TabManager` tracks `activeId` (focused tab) and `playbackOwnerId` (audible tab) separately, and
`getEffectivePlayer()` resolves them: if the focused tab has a current track it wins, otherwise the
playback owner does. This is what lets you browse tab 2 while tab 1 keeps playing, and it is why the
`playerController` exported from `playerStore` is a facade — read methods hit the effective player,
while `loadTrack`/`playTrackById` first *claim* the focused tab as the new owner.

## 6. Persistence

| Store | Location | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Durable app settings | `<app_data_dir>/settings-v1.json` (Rust, mutex-guarded) | Mirror of every UI setting: theme, shortcuts, window geometry, mini-player position, sidebar mode, toolbar/home-section toggles, audio quality, tray, onboarding flags |
| localStorage | WebView profile | Same settings (fast path) + session, play history, local playlists, playlist membership, offline manifest, recent playlists, recent searches, update snoozes |
| Data cache | `<app_cache_dir>/data-cache-v1/entries/<fnv1a>.json` | Library, playlists, albums, artists, tracks, browse pages, lyrics, search results. LRU-evicted to a configurable budget (default 4 GiB) |
| Offline audio | `<app_data_dir>/offline-audio-v1/<trackId>.bin` | Downloaded track bytes. The frontend keeps the metadata manifest in localStorage and reconciles it against `offline_audio_list`. Pruned oldest-first to a configurable ceiling (default 8 GiB) |
| In-memory media bodies | `MediaServer.items`, Rust process | The audio currently playing and the one preloaded. Hard cap of 3 entries, coldest evicted — see [backend.md](./backend.md) §3 |
| Secrets | OS keyring (`com.ytmusicdock.app`) — plus an AES-GCM file on macOS | YouTube cookie header, Last.fm session key |
| Logs | `<app_log_dir>/current.log` | Truncated on every launch; older `*.log` files deleted |

"Delete all app data" in Settings clears them: `clearAppSettings()`, `clearCache()`,
`clearAppSession()`, `removeAllDownloads()`, `localStorage.clear()`, plus sign-out.

## 7. Platform integrations

| Integration | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Discord Rich Presence | `player/DiscordRPC.ts` → `discord_rpc_update` / `_clear` → `discord_rpc.rs` | Client id `1515682467154100344`. Timestamps derived from position so Discord shows a live progress bar. Artwork is forced to `i.ytimg.com/vi/<id>/hqdefault.jpg` for YouTube tracks because Google CDN hosts block Discord's fetcher. Toggleable (`ui/settings/discord.ts`). |
| YouTube Music history | `YouTubeMusicDataSource.beginPlayReport` / `updatePlayReport`, driven by `PlayerController` | Off by default (`ui/settings/youtubeAccount.ts`). Native engine only — the IFrame embed reports its own plays, so pinging as well would double-count. A play counts only when reported watch time grows with real elapsed time: a single ping claiming a whole track was heard is accepted with 204 and recorded as nothing. |
| Last.fm | `player/LastFm.ts` → `lastfm_*` → `lastfm.rs` | Desktop auth-token flow opened in the system browser; session key in the keyring; MD5 `api_sig` computed in Rust. |
| Windows SMTC | `windows_media.rs` | `MediaPlayer`/`SystemMediaTransportControls` for the OS overlay, plus taskbar thumbnail toolbar buttons. Sends `windows-media-control` events back to JS. |
| macOS Now Playing | `macos_media.rs` | `MPNowPlayingInfoCenter` via `objc2`. Requires `macOSPrivateApi: true`. |
| Other platforms | `useMediaSession.ts` | Falls back to `navigator.mediaSession` with metadata, position state, and action handlers. |
| Tray icon | `lib.rs` `build_tray()` | Always built so the setting takes effect without a restart. With "minimize to tray" on, closing the main window hides it and playback continues; the tray menu restores or quits. |
| Local folder watching | `lib.rs` `local_audio_watch` (`notify`) | Emits `local-audio-changed` with no detail — a rescan is cheap and diffing renames/temp files would be far more code for the same result. |
| Autostart | `ui/settings/autostart.ts` | `tauri-plugin-autostart`. |
| Updates | `internal/updateChecker.ts` | `tauri-plugin-updater`, minisign-signed, endpoints on GitHub Releases (`latest.json`) and an `updater-channel` branch. macOS is notify-only. |

## 8. Build, test, release, security

**Build:** `npm run dev` (Vite only) · `npm run tauri dev` · `npm run tauri build`
(runs `tsc && vite build` first via `beforeBuildCommand`). Bundle targets: `all`,
with updater artifacts enabled. Linux AppImage bundles the media framework; the RPM declares
webkit2gtk4.1 / gtk3 / libayatana-appindicator and recommends the GStreamer plugin sets.

**Checks:** `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) and `npm run check` — the latter runs
`scripts/run-checks.mjs`, which finds every `*.check.ts` under `src/`, bundles it with esbuild's JS
API and runs each in its own process with a 30 s timeout. `npm run verify` is both. The Rust side
has a `#[cfg(test)]` module in `lib.rs` — 14 tests (`cargo test`). There is no component/DOM test harness.

**Repo layout beyond the app:** `landing/` is a separate Vite site for the product page,
`packaging/` holds the AUR PKGBUILD, `manifests/` holds the winget submission. Workflows:
`ci.yml`, `release.yml`, `aur.yml`.

**Security posture:**

- `app.security.csp` is `null` — no CSP is enforced. Needed because the app loads the YouTube
  IFrame API from `youtube.com` at runtime; worth revisiting if that path ever changes.
- `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` allowlists core and plugin permissions per window. Note its
  `command.allow` / `allowlist` blocks are Tauri 1 syntax and no longer gate anything (see
  [backend.md](./backend.md) §4) — they are stale relative to `generate_handler!`.
- Log sanitization happens twice: `internal/logging.ts` redacts before sending, and Rust's
  `sanitize_log_message` / `sanitize_log_url` redact again before writing to disk. The URL
  sanitizer keeps the diagnostic params (`expire`, `itag`, `c`, `cver`, `clen`) and replaces
  signatures with a `[9ch]`-style length marker.
- Discord and artwork URLs are validated against host allowlists before leaving the app.
- The cookie jar only accepts `Set-Cookie` from YouTube hosts — a suffix match alone would hand the
  session to a lookalike domain, which is what `is_youtube_cookie_host` guards.
- Signed `googlevideo.com` URLs carry an `ip=` parameter; the Rust client binds its local address
  to the matching IP family so the signature stays valid.
- `local_audio_read` / `local_audio_write_tags` re-validate the path and extension rather than
  trusting the frontend.

## 9. Known dead code and rough edges

Recorded so nobody re-derives them:

- `src/datasource/youtube/YouTubeDataSource.ts` (809 lines) — superseded by `YouTubeMusicDataSource`, not imported.
- `src/player/Recommender.ts` — stub returning `[]`, not imported. Recommendations live in the data source.
- `src/ui/components/MagicDice.tsx` — not imported; `DiceCard.tsx` is the live one.
- `src/ui/components/player/ExpandedPlayerBar.tsx` — its render block is still commented out in
  `App.tsx` (~line 1954); the `isExpandedPlayerBar` state and toggle are live and do nothing visible.
- `greet` command in `lib.rs` — Tauri scaffolding leftover, still registered.
- `capabilities/default.json` `command.allow` — Tauri 1 leftover; missing every command added since
  (all `offline_audio_*`, `read_text_file`, `write_text_file`, `local_audio_*_tags`,
  `local_audio_watch`/`unwatch`, `refresh_youtube_music_cookie`, `open_current_log`) and nothing
  broke, which is the proof it is inert.
- Gapless and crossfade silently do nothing in `native` audio-engine mode — they ride the standby
  IFrame deck, which that mode has no equivalent of. The Settings copy says so, but nothing in the
  code prevents the combination. **`rust` mode is the fix**: it has two real decks and mixes
  them, and unlike the IFrame pair they open whatever they are handed — a signed URL, a file in
  the offline store, a path on disk — so a downloaded album is gapless too. `player/preloadDeck.ts`
  holds the rule and `preloadDeck.check.ts` pins it: the IFrame deck must keep excluding anything
  read from disk, because it resolves its own stream from a video id and would fetch the online
  copy of a track the user downloaded on purpose.
- Playback rate on the `rust` engine resamples, so it transposes — the `<audio>` element corrected
  pitch for free via `preservesPitch`. Marked `ponytail:` at `native_audio_set_rate`; the fix is a
  time-stretcher between the decoder and the sink.
- `MediaServer` — the loopback `TcpListener`, `MEDIA_SERVER_MAX_ITEMS`, `Cache-Control: no-store`
  and `parse_media_range` — exists only to hand bytes to an `<audio>` element. In `rust` mode it is
  never started from cold and `media_server_release` drops its bodies when switched into
  mid-session, so what remains resident is one thread parked in `accept()`. Deleting the rest waits
  on `rust` becoming the only engine; `fetch_audio_source` goes with it. `MediaBuffer` stays — the
  Rust decoder reads through it.
- `app.security.csp` can only be tightened once the IFrame path is gone; the `rust` engine loads
  nothing from `youtube.com` at runtime, so it is the precondition rather than the change.
- `App.tsx` is 2156 lines with ~30 `useEffect` blocks, some at zero indentation — still the
  highest-value refactor target in the repo.
- `getStreamUrl` on the YouTube Music data source is required by the abstract class but never called
  by the controllers.
