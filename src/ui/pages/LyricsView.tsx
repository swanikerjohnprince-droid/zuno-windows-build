        The cover, oversized and blurred past recognition, is the only colour on the screen.
        Sized at the smallest variant deliberately: nothing above 120px survives the blur, so a
        larger source would cost texture memory and show nothing.

        The radius is 32px, not 70px. This is the most expensive single element in the app: a
        136%-of-window box, so ~2600x1470 on a 1080p display, which is a 15 MB layer before the
        filter has done anything — and blur cost scales with radius, because Chromium runs more
        downsample passes and allocates intermediates expanded by it.

        70px was buying almost nothing. The source is a 120px image stretched roughly twenty
        times, so one source pixel already covers ~20 display pixels and the upscale is doing
        the softening; 70px of filter was ~3.5 source pixels of extra blur on top of that.
        32px is the radius `Layout` settled on for the same trick at the same upscale, for the
        same reason. Toggle Settings > Potato PC > Manage > "Blur and colour filters" to see
        the whole class of effect on and off.
