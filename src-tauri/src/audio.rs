 * Native decode and output.
 *
 * symphonia decodes, cpal plays, rodio wires the two together and resamples to whatever the
 * output device wants. This exists to replace the hidden `youtube.com` IFrame — a whole
 * subframe process, roughly 90 MB — and the `<audio>` element behind it.
 *
 * Two sinks stand in for the two IFrame decks. The next track is decoded and appended to the
 * standby sink while the current one is still playing, so a handover is a volume ramp between
 * two live sinks rather than a stop followed by a load. That is what makes gapless and
 * crossfade work here, which they never did on the `<audio>` path.
 *
 * Everything runs on one owned thread behind a channel. cpal's stream handle is not `Send` on
 * every backend and Tauri state must be, so nothing but the `Sender` leaves this module. The
 * same thread runs the position tick out of its own `recv_timeout`, rather than a second thread
 * contending for the same state.
