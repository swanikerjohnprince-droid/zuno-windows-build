/**
 * Self-check for lyric source ranking. No test runner in this project, so:
 *
 *   npx esbuild src/datasource/youtube/lyricsSources.check.ts --bundle --platform=node
 *     --format=esm --outfile=check.mjs && node check.mjs
 *
 * The sources are raced in parallel, so without an explicit rank the winner is whichever
 * host answered first — which is exactly backwards: the slow exact-duration match is the one
 * worth waiting for. This pins that the table, not the network, decides.
